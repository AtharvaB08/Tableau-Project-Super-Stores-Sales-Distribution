# Tableau Project - Super Stores Sales Distribution

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to examine the **sales performance**, **profitability**, and **regional distribution** of a chain of superstores. This dashboard aims to provide a visual representation of key business metrics, including:
- Category distribution
- Discounts vs. profit
- Sales segments
- Regional performance across the United States

## Dashboard Overview
This Tableau dashboard covers a wide range of metrics that provide insights into superstore operations, including sales, profits, discounts, and performance by product category, region, and customer segment.

## Analysis Breakdown
The analysis is divided into several key areas:

### 1. Category Distribution:
- The sales and profit data are categorized into three primary categories:
  - **Furniture**
  - **Office Supplies**
  - **Technology**
- **Office Supplies** (especially Binders and Paper) lead in quantity sold. However, categories such as **Bookcases** and **Tables** report **negative profits**, indicating potential issues with pricing or high discount rates.

### 2. Discount vs. Profit:
- A scatter plot illustrates the relationship between **discount percentages** and **profit margins**.
- Discounts greater than **20%** correlate with **negative profits**, while moderate discounts around **10%** still yield significant profit (up to **$8,400**).

### 3. Profit vs. Quantity:
- Products with higher profits (between **$5K to $8K**) tend to have higher quantities sold, highlighting the efficiency of popular products in driving profitability.

### 4. Segment Sales:
- The sales distribution across different segments is as follows:
  - **Consumer**: 50.56%
  - **Corporate**: 30.74%
  - **Home Office**: 18.70%

### 5. Region Distribution:
- Profit, quantity, and sales data are distributed across different regions:
  - The **West** leads with the highest sales and profit, with significant performance in **California**.
  - The **East** and **South** regions show moderate levels of sales and profitability.
  - The **Central** region lags behind, with notably lower sales and profit metrics.

### 6. Profit Spread Across the Country:
- A **profit distribution map** shows how different states contribute to overall profitability:
  - **California** is the top-performing state, with the highest profit of **$76,381**.
  - **Colorado** reports the largest loss of **-$6,528**, followed by **Oregon** with **-$1,190**.

## Key Trends
1. **Product Profitability**: 
   - **Office supplies** (especially Binders and Paper) are the top-performing products in terms of quantity.
   - **Furniture-related categories** (e.g., Bookcases, Tables) show negative profitability, indicating areas that need **price optimization** or **marketing focus**.

2. **Discounting Impact**: 
   - Excessive discounting (over **30%**) has a detrimental effect on profits.
   - This highlights the need to **limit** or **better strategize** discount offers to avoid significant losses.

3. **Regional Insights**: 
   - The **West** region dominates in terms of profitability, with **California** being the most profitable state.
   - Certain states such as **Colorado** and **Oregon** face considerable losses, requiring further investigation into localized business strategies.

4. **Segment Performance**: 
   - The **Consumer** segment represents the largest share of sales (50.56%), making it the most crucial target audience for maximizing revenue.
   - **Corporate clients** follow closely, but the **Home Office** segment offers room for growth.

## Conclusion
This dashboard reveals significant insights into **sales performance** across various categories, regions, and customer segments. It emphasizes the importance of:
- **Maintaining balanced discount strategies**
- **Optimizing underperforming categories** (Furniture)
- **Tailoring region-specific business strategies** to boost profitability

Continued monitoring and adjustment in discounting and regional marketing strategies will likely improve the overall financial health of the business.
